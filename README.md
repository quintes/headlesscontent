# headlesscontent
An example of using Drupal JSON API from an external site in a decoupled/headless manner

The example will require a Drupal instance, with CORS configured.

In this example the site is a static site querying the Drupal CMS using JQuery. It could have been react or angular, doesn't matter as the objective is met.
